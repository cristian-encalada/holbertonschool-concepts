## Learning Objectives
### General
* How to use the ``exit`` function
* What are the functions ``calloc`` and ``realloc`` from the standard library and how to use them
## Quiz answers
* Question #0
- To allocate enough space for an array of 10 integers (on a 64bit, Linux machine), I can use:
	- malloc(10 * sizeof(int))
* Question #1
- If I want to copy the string “Best School” into a new space in memory, I can use this statement to reserve enough space for it (select all valid answers):
	- malloc(sizeof(“Best School”))
	- malloc(12)
	- malloc(strlen(“Best School”) + 1)
* Question #2
- malloc returns a pointer
	- True
* Question #3
- malloc returns an address
	- True
* Question #4
- What is wrong with this code:
```

int cp(void)
{
    char *s;

    s = malloc(12);
    strcpy(s, "Best School");
    return (0);
}
```
	 * There is no comment
	 * malloc can fail so we should check its return value all the time before using the pointers returned by the function.
* Question #5
- You can do this:
```
free("Best School");
```
	* No
* Question #6
- You can do this:
```
char str[] = "Best School";

free (str);
```
	* No
* Question #7
- You can do this:
```
char *s;

s = strdup("Best School");
if (s != NULL)
{
    free(s);
}
```
	- Yes
* Question #8
- The memory space reserved when calling malloc is on:
	- The heap
* Question #9
- What will you see on the terminal?
```
int main(void)
{
    int *ptr;

    *ptr = 98;
    printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    return (0);
}
```
