## Learning Objectives

__Q1. What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them__

__Operator in Computer Programming__

In computer programing, an operator is a character, symbol, keyword, or combination of those. It determines what action gets performed on one or more operands.

__An operand__ is an individual data item that gets manipulated by the operator.

__Types of Operators in C Programming__

__1. Unary operators__. Operate on a single operand.

Some of the unary operators in C are:
- Arithmetic operators such as the increment operator(++) and the decrement operator(--).
- Logical operators like the NOT(!) operator. 
- Bitwise operators like the NOT(~).

__2. Binary operators__. Operate on two operands. Some of the binary operators in C are:

- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %). 
- Equality/Relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=). 
- Logical/Conditional operators such as the AND(&&) and OR(||) operators.
- Bitwise operators ((&, |, ^, <<, >>)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=),

__3. Ternary operators__ Operates on three operands. The general syntax looks something similar to the following:
```
(condition) ? expression1 : expression2;
```

That being sad, __Binary arithmetic operators__ (+, -, *, /, %) perform mathematical calculations on numerical data such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder.

__Q2. What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them?__

The logical operators evaluate the logical expression and return a result.

A logical expression is a combination of logical operators with one or multiple conditions.

The result is always a Boolean value. A Boolean value determines whether the expression is true or false.

There are three logical operators in C programming: `logical AND(&&)`, `logical OR(||)`, and `logical NOT (!)`.

__Q3. What the the relational operators? How to use them__

Equality/Relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=). Compare two values and determine if one operand is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to the other operand.

{
    printf("%d\n", a);
    a++;
}
```
```
a = 0;
while (a < b)
