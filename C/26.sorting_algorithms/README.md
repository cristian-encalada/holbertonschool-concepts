## Advanced Tasks

__4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence__

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) algorithm, using the `Knuth sequence`

- Prototype: `void shell_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- You must use the following sequence of intervals (a.k.a the Knuth sequence):
   - n+1 = n * 3 + 1
   - 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...
- You’re expected to print the array each time you decrease the interval (See example below).

__No big O notations of the time complexity of the Shell sort (Knuth sequence) algorithm needed - as the complexity is dependent on the size of array and gap__

```C
alex@/tmp/sort$ cat 100-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "sort.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7};
    size_t n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    print_array(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    shell_sort(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    print_array(array, n);
    return (0);

__9. Radix sort__

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) algorithm

- Prototype: `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- You must implement the `LSD` radix sort algorithm
- You can assume that `array` will contain only numbers `>= 0`
- You are allowed to use `malloc` and `free` for this task
- You’re expected to print the `array` each time you increase your `significant digit` (See example below)

```C
alex@/tmp/sort$ cat 105-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "sort.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0

    print_array(array, n);

__10. Bitonic sort__

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bitonic sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter) algorithm

- Prototype: `void bitonic_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
- You can assume that `size` will be equal to `2^k`, where `k >= 0` (when `array` is `not` `NULL` …)
- You are allowed to use `printf`
- You’re expected to print the `array` each time you swap two elements (See example below)
- Output: see example

Write in the file `106-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bitonic sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

```C

__11. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme__

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

- Prototype: `void quick_sort_hoare(int *array, size_t size)`;
- You must implement the `Hoare` partition scheme.
- The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
- You’re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file `107-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

__12. Dealer__

Write a function that sorts a deck of cards.

- Prototype: `void sort_deck(deck_node_t **deck);`
- You are allowed to use the C standard library function `qsort`
- Please use the following data structures:

```C
typedef enum kind_e
{
    SPADE = 0,
    HEART,
    CLUB,
    DIAMOND
} kind_t;

/**
 * struct card_s - Playing card
 *
 * @value: Value of the card
 * From "Ace" to "King"
 * @kind: Kind of the card
 */
typedef struct card_s
{
    const char *value;
    const kind_t kind;
} card_t;

/**
 * struct deck_node_s - Deck of card
 *
 * @card: Pointer to the card of the node
 * @prev: Pointer to the previous node of the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next node of the list
 */
typedef struct deck_node_s
{
    const card_t *card;
    struct deck_node_s *prev;
    struct deck_node_s *next;
} deck_node_t;
```

- You have to push you deck.h header file, containing the previous data structures definition
- Each node of the doubly linked list contains a card that you cannot modify. You have to swap the nodes.
- You can assume there is exactly 52 elements in the doubly linked list.
- You are free to use the sorting algorithm of your choice
- The deck must be ordered:
    - From Ace to King
    - From Spades to Diamonds
    - See example below

```C
alex@/tmp/sort$ cat 1000-main.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "deck.h"

void print_deck(const deck_node_t *deck)
{
    size_t i;
    char kinds[4] = {'S', 'H', 'C', 'D'};

    i = 0;
    while (deck)
    {
        if (i)
            printf(", ");
        printf("{%s, %c}", deck->card->value, kinds[deck->card->kind]);
        if (i == 12)
            printf("\n");
        i = (i + 1) % 13;
        deck = deck->next;
    }
}

deck_node_t *init_deck(const card_t cards[52])
{
    deck_node_t *deck;
    deck_node_t *node;
    size_t i;

    i = 52;
    deck = NULL;
    while (i--)
    {
        node = malloc(sizeof(*node));
        if (!node)
            return (NULL);
        node->card = &cards[i];
        node->next = deck;
        node->prev = NULL;
        if (deck)
            deck->prev = node;
        deck = node;
    }
    return (deck);
}

int main(void)
{
    card_t cards[52] = {
        {"Jack", CLUB}, {"4", HEART}, {"3", HEART}, {"3", DIAMOND}, {"Queen", HEART}, {"5", HEART}, {"5", SPADE}, {"10", HEART}, {"6", HEART}, {"5", DIAMOND}, {"6", SPADE}, {"9", HEART}, {"7", DIAMOND}, {"Jack", SPADE}, {"Ace", DIAMOND}, {"9", CLUB}, {"Jack", DIAMOND}, {"7", SPADE}, {"King", DIAMOND}, {"10", CLUB}, {"King", SPADE}, {"8", CLUB}, {"9", SPADE}, {"6", CLUB}, {"Ace", CLUB}, {"3", SPADE}, {"8", SPADE}, {"9", DIAMOND}, {"2", HEART}, {"4", DIAMOND}, {"6", DIAMOND}, {"3", CLUB}, {"Queen", CLUB}, {"10", SPADE}, {"8", DIAMOND}, {"8", HEART}, {"Ace", SPADE}, {"Jack", HEART}, {"2", CLUB}, {"4", SPADE}, {"2", SPADE}, {"2", DIAMOND}, {"King", CLUB}, {"Queen", SPADE}, {"Queen", DIAMOND}, {"7", CLUB}, {"7", HEART}, {"5", CLUB}, {"10", DIAMOND}, {"4", CLUB}, {"King", HEART}, {"Ace", HEART},

    print_deck(deck);
    printf("\n");
    sort_deck(&deck);

    print_deck(deck);
    return (0);
